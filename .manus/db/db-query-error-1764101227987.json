This comprehensive guide explores evidence-based strategies for optimizing SBRT treatment planning to achieve superior clinical outcomes while minimizing treatment-related toxicity.\n\n## Understanding SBRT Fundamentals\n\nSBRT delivers ablative doses of radiation (typically 48-60 Gy) in 3-5 fractions to small, well-defined tumors. The biological effectiveness of these hypofractionated regimens far exceeds conventional fractionation, with biologically effective doses (BED) often exceeding 100 Gy when calculated using an α/β ratio of 10 Gy for tumor tissue.\n\n### Key Planning Objectives\n\nThe primary goals of lung SBRT planning include:\n\n- **Tumor Coverage**: Achieving 95-99% PTV coverage with the prescription dose\n- **Dose Conformity**: Maintaining a conformity index (CI) of 1.0-1.2\n- **Gradient Index**: Achieving rapid dose fall-off outside the PTV (GI < 5.0)\n- **OAR Sparing**: Respecting strict dose constraints for critical structures\n\n## Target Volume Delineation\n\nAccurate target delineation is paramount for successful SBRT outcomes. The gross tumor volume (GTV) should be contoured on all phases of 4D-CT imaging to account for respiratory motion.\n\n### Internal Target Volume (ITV) Considerations\n\nThe ITV encompasses the GTV across all respiratory phases. Modern approaches include:\n\n1. **Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP)**: Useful for identifying tumor motion envelope\n2. **Average Intensity Projection (AIP)**: Represents time-weighted tumor position\n3. **Phase-based Contouring**: Manual contouring on each respiratory phase for complex cases\n\nThe planning target volume (PTV) margin should account for setup uncertainty (typically 3-5 mm) while considering proximity to critical structures. Asymmetric margins may be appropriate when tumors abut the chest wall or mediastinum.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOptimizing SBRT for lung cancer requires meticulous attention to target delineation, dose prescription, critical structure constraints, and motion management. By implementing evidence-based planning strategies and maintaining rigorous quality assurance, radiation oncology teams can achieve excellent local control rates while minimizing treatment-related morbidity.', 'clinical-practice', 'SBRT, lung cancer, treatment planning, radiation therapy, dose optimization', 1, 'Dr. Sarah Chen', 'MD, DABR', 8, 0, 1, '2025-01-15', NOW(), NOW())",
